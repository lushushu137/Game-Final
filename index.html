            The gameplay is that the player as a scrub woman in a bathhouse,
            scrubs the back of ladies. During the scrubbing process, the player
            talks to guests and know their stories.  The player’s choice earns
            him or her different money.  The player’s choice may change guests’
            lives.<br /><br />
            The guest characters are diversified. There is teenage girl who
            suffers from appearance anxiety , middle-aged woman facing a
            mid-life crisis, and young woman fighting the gender
            stereotypes. They all have their own troubles, reflecting the
            various problems women encounter in this society. I borrowed the
            naked woman and the red blanket from the painting.

        <p>
          I have designed five characters so far, all very different in age,
          class and profession, but sharing a common identity: women. I hope to
          show as many and as rich a portrayal of women as possible, and their
          most realistic plight.

              mess of it and gets ridiculed, so she feels very inferior and
              depressed.

              she often encounters questions and molestation about her ability
              because of her appearance. She was very unconvinced, but did not
              know how to fight for herself.

              within five years. However, her family did not understand,
              believing that a woman was incomplete without marriage and that
              she would not be able to marry if she took up boxing.

        <h1>UI/UX</h1>
        <div class="flex-row">
          <p>
            Inspired by The White Door, I split my game screen into two parts. I
            make this decision for the following reason. First, there is a need
            to actually show the process of dirt being removing off. This is
            important to give the player the mental satisfaction of removing bad
            thing. Therefore, the detail of woman back need to be showed.
            Second, if there is only woman backs, it will be boring. I add
            animation and environment to make the game more enriched. The
            bathhouse environment can also provide possibilities for the further
            design – for example, player can use their coins to decorate the
            bathhouse, or make diegetic UI elements like clock, spa stuff etc.

        <h1>VISUAL STYLE</h1>
        <div class="flex-row">
          <p>
            Visually I borrowed from Playable Studios' Kids. I used simple lines
            to represent the environment and characters, and avoided showing
            what the characters look like. I took this decision for two reasons.
            First, since the environment is a female bathhouse, I didn't want to
            make players of other genders think too much about a scene they
            hadn't been to before. Second, making the characters anonymous was
            also due to the specificity of the subject matter. I didn‘t want to
            make naked women the object of male gaze again, to be judged in
            terms of body and appearance, thus running counter to the original
            purpose of the game.
